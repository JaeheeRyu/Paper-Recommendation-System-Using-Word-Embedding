Abstract

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has shown great success
in automating the design of neural networks, but the pro-
hibitive amount of computations behind current NAS meth-
ods requires further investigations in improving the sample
efﬁciency and the network evaluation cost to get better results
in a shorter time. In this paper, we present a novel scalable
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based NAS agent, named
AlphaX, to tackle these two aspects. AlphaX improves the
search efﬁciency by adaptively balancing the exploration and
exploitation at the state level, and by a Meta-Deep Neural
Network (DNN) to predict network accuracies for biasing the
search toward a promising region. To amortize the network
evaluation cost, AlphaX accelerates MCTS rollouts with a
distributed design and reduces the number of epochs in eval-
uating a network by transfer learning, which is guided with
the tree structure in MCTS. In 12 GPU days and 1000 sam-
ples, AlphaX found an architecture that reaches 97.84% top-1
accuracy on CIFAR-10, and 75.5% top-1 accuracy on Ima-
geNet, exceeding SOTA NAS methods in both the accuracy
and sampling efﬁciency. Particularly, we also evaluate Al-
phaX on NASBench-101, a large scale NAS dataset; AlphaX
is 3x and 2.8x more sample efﬁcient than Random Search
and Regularized Evolution in ﬁnding the global optimum. Fi-
nally, we show the searched architecture improves a variety
of vision applications from Neural Style Transfer, to Image
Captioning and Object Detection.

Introduction

Designing efﬁcient neural architectures is extremely labo-
rious. A typical design iteration starts with a heuristic de-
sign hypothesis from domain experts, followed by the de-
sign validation with hours of GPU training. The entire de-
sign process requires many of such iterations before ﬁnd-
ing a satisfying architecture. Neural Architecture Search has
emerged as a promising tool to alleviate human effort in this
trial and error design process, but the tremendous computing
resources required by current NAS methods motivate us to
investigate both the search efﬁciency and the network eval-
uation cost.
AlphaGo/AlphaGoZero (Silver et al. 2016; Tian et al.
2019) have recently shown super-human performance in
playing the game of Go, by using a speciﬁc search al-
gorithm called Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (Kocsis

and Szepesv ´ari 2006). Given the current game state, MCTS
gradually builds an online model for its subsequent game
states to evaluate the winning chance at that state, based
on search experiences in the current and prior games, and
makes a decision. The search experience is from the previ-
ous search trajectories (called rollouts) that have been tried,
and their consequences (whether the player wins or not).

Table 1: Highlights of NAS search algorithms: compared

to DeepArchitect and Wistuba, AlphaX makes several con-
tributions toward a practical MCTS based NAS agent by im-
proving the sample efﬁciency with an effective multi-stage
metaDNN, and amortizes the network evaluation costs by a
distirbuted design and transfer learning.

Different from the traditional MCTS approach that evalu-
ates the consequence of a trajectory by random self-play to
the end of a game, AlphaGo uses a predictive model (or
value network) to predict the consequence, which enjoys
much lower variance. Furthermore, due to its built-in explo-
ration mechanism using Upper Conﬁdence bound applied to
Trees (UCT) (Auer, Cesa-Bianchi, and Fischer 2002), based
on its online model, MCTS dynamically adapts itself to the
most promising search regions, where good consequences
are likely to happen.
Inspired by this idea, we present AlphaX, a NAS agent
that uses MCTS for efﬁcient architecture search with Meta-
DNN as a predictive model to estimate the accuracy of
a sampled architecture. Compared with Random Search,
AlphaX builds an online model which guides the future
search; compared to greedy methods, e.g. Q-learning, Reg-
ularized Evolution or Top-K methods, AlphaX dynami-
cally trades off exploration and exploitation and can es-
cape from locally optimal solutions with fewer search trials.
Fig. 1 summarizes the trade-offs. Furthermore, while prior
works applied MCTS to Architecture Search (Wistuba 2017;
Negrinho and Gordon 2017), they lack an effective model to
accurately predict rewards, and the expensive network eval-
uations in MCTS rollouts still remain unaddressed. Toward
a practical MCTS-based NAS agent, AlphaX has two novel
features: ﬁrst, a highly accurate multi-stage meta-DNN to
improve the sample efﬁciency; and second, the use of trans-
fer learning, together with a scalable distributed design, to
amortize the network evaluation costs. As a result, AlphaX
is the ﬁrst MCTS-based NAS agent that reports SOTA accu-
racies on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet in on par with the
SOTA end-to-end search time.

Monte Carlo Tree Search: DeepArchitect (Negrinho and
Gordon 2017) implemented vanilla MCTS for NAS without
a predictive model, and Wistuba (Wistuba 2017) uses statis-
tics from the current search (e.g., RAVE and Contextual Re-
ward Prediction) to predict the performance of a state. In
comparison, our performance estimate is from both searched
rollouts so far and a model (meta-DNN) learned from perfor-
mances of known architectures and can generalize to unseen
architectures. Besides, the prior works do not address the
expensive network evaluations in MCTS rollouts, while Al-
phaX solves this issue with a distributed design and transfer
learning, making important improvements toward a practical
MCTS based NAS agent.
Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a popular method for the
hyper-parameter search (Kandasamy, Schneider, and P ´oczos
2015). BO has proven to be successful for small scale prob-
lems, e.g. hyper-parameter tuning of Stochastic Gradient
Descent (SGD). Though BO variants, e.g. TPE (Bergstra
et al. 2011), have tackled the cubic scaling issue in Gaus-
sian Process, optimizing the acquisition function in a high
dimensional search space that contains over 1017 neural ar-
chitectures become the bottleneck.
Reinforcement Learning (RL): Several RL techniques
have been investigated for NAS (Baker et al. 2016; Zoph and
Le 2016). Baker et al. proposed a Q-learning agent to design
network architectures (Baker et al. 2016). The agent takes
a -greedy policy: with probability 1 − , it chooses the ac-
tion that leads to the best expected return (i.e. accuracy) es-
timated by the current model, otherwise uniformly chooses
an action. Zoph et al. built an RNN agent trained with Policy
Gradient to design CNN and LSTM (Zoph and Le 2016).
However, directly maximizing the expected reward in Pol-
icy Gradient could lead to local optimal solution (Nachum,
Norouzi, and Schuurmans 2016).
Hill Climbing (HC): Elsken et al. proposed a simple hill
climbing for NAS (Elsken, Metzen, and Hutter 2017). Start-
ing from an architecture, they train every descendent net-
work before moving to the best performing child. Liu et al.
deployed a beam search which follows a similar procedure
to hill climbing but selects the top-K architectures instead
of only the best (Liu et al. 2017a). HC is akin to the vanilla
Policy Gradient tending to trap into a local optimum from
which it can never escape, while MCTS demonstrates prov-
able convergence toward the global optimum given enough
samples (Kocsis and Szepesv ´ari 2006).
Evolutionary Algorithm (EA): Evolutionary algorithms
represent each neural network as a string of genes and search
the architecture space by mutation and recombinations (Real
et al. 2018). Strings which represent a neural network with
top performance are selected to generate child models. The
selection process is in lieu of exploitation, and the mutation
is to encourage exploration. Still, GA algorithms do not con-
sider the visiting statistics at individual states, and it lacks an
online model to inform decisions.

Figure 2: Overview of AlphaX search procedures: explanations of four steps are in sec.3.2.

to inform future decisions. We implement a state as a map
that deﬁnes all the hyper-parameters for each network layer
and their dependencies. We also introduce a special terminal
state to allow for multiple actions. All the other states can
transit to the terminal state by taking the terminal action, and
the agent only trains the network, from which it reaches the
terminal. With the terminal state, the agent freely modiﬁes
the architecture before reaching the terminal. This enables
multiple actions for the design agent to bypass shallow ar-
chitectures.
Action Space: an action morphs the current network ar-
chitecture, i.e. current state, to transit to the next state. It
not only explicitly speciﬁes the inter-layer connectivity, but
also all the necessary hyper-parameters for each layer. Un-
like games, actions in NAS are dynamically changing w.r.t
the current state and design spaces. For example, AlphaX
needs to leverage the current DAG (state) in enumerating all
the feasible actions of ’adding an edge’. In our experiments,
the actions for the NASNet search domain are adding a new
layer in the left or right branch of a Block in a cell, creating a
new block with different input combinations, and the termi-
nating action. The actions for the NASBench search domain
are either adding a node or an edge, and the terminating ac-
tion.

3.2 Search Procedure

This section elaborates the integration of MCTS and
metaDNN. The purpose of MCTS is to analyze the most
promising move at a state, while the purpose of meta-DNN
is to learn the sampled architecture performance and to gen-
eralize to unexplored architectures so that MCTS can sim-
ulate many rollouts with only an actual training in evaluat-
ing a new node. The superior search efﬁciency of AlphaX
is due to balancing the exploration and exploitation at the
ﬁnest granularity, i.e. state level, by leveraging the visiting
statistics. Each node tracks these two statistics: 1) N (s, a)
counts the selection of action a at state s; 2) Q(s, a) is the
expected reward after taking action a at state s, and intu-
itively Q(s, a) is an estimate of how promising this search

3.1 Design, State and Action Space

Design Space: the neural architectures for different domain
tasks, e.g. object detection and image classiﬁcation, follow
fundamentally different designs. This renders different de-
sign spaces for the design agent. AlphaX is ﬂexible to sup-
port various search spaces with an intuitive state and ac-
tion abstraction. Here we provide a brief description of two
search spaces used in our experiments.
• NASNet Search Space: (Zoph et al. 2017) proposes
searching a hierarchical Cell structure as shown in Fig.3a.
There are two types of Cells, Normal Cell (N C ell) and
Reduction Cell (RC ell). N C ell maintains the input and
output dimensions with the padding, while RC ell reduces
the height and width by half with the striding. Then, the
network is constituted by stacking multiple cells.
• NASBench Search Space: (Ying et al. 2019) proposes
searching a small Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) with each
node representing a layer and each edge representing the
inter-layer dependency as shown in Fig.3b. Similarly, the
network is constituted by stacking multiple such DAGs.
State Space: a state represents a network architecture, and
AlphaX utilizes states (or nodes) to keep track of past trails

Fig.2 demonstrates a typical searching iteration
in AlphaX, which consists of Selection, Expansion, Meta-
DNN assisted Simulation, and Backpropagation. We eluci-
date each step as follows.
Selection traverses down the search tree to trace the cur-
rent most promising search path. It starts from the root and
stops till reaching a leaf. At a node, the agent selects actions
based on UCB1 (Auer, Cesa-Bianchi, and Fischer 2002):

where N (s) is the number of visits to the state s (i.e.
a∈A N (s, a)), and c is a constant. The ﬁrst term
N (s,a) ) is the exploitation term estimating the expected ac-
curacy of its descendants. The second term (2c
is the exploration term encouraging less visited nodes. The
exploration term dominates πtree (s) if N (s, a) is small, and
the exploitation term otherwise. As a result, the agent favors
the exploration in the beginning until building proper conﬁ-
dences to exploit. c controls the weight of exploration, and
it is empirically set to 0.5. We iterate the tree policy to reach
a new node.
Expansion adds a new node into the tree. Q(s, a) and
N (s, a) are initialized to zeros. Q(s, a) will be updated in
the simulation step.

Meta-DNN assisted Simulation randomly samples the

descendants of a new node to approximate Q(s, a) of the
node with their accuracies. The process is to estimate how
promising the search direction rendered by the new node and
its descendants. The simulation starts at the new node. The
agent traverses down the tree by taking the uniform-random
action until reaching a terminal state, then it dispatches the
architecture for training.
The more simulation we roll, the more accurate estimate
of this search direction we get. However, we cannot conduct
many simulations as network training is extremely time-
consuming. AlphaX adopts a novel hybrid strategy to solve
this issue by incorporating a meta-DNN to predict the net-
work accuracy in addition to the actual training. We delay
the introduction of meta-DNN to sec.3.3. Speciﬁcally, we
estimate q = Q(s, a) with

where s(cid:48) = s + a, and sim(s(cid:48) ) represents a simulation
starting from state s(cid:48) . Acc is the actually trained accuracy
in the ﬁrst simulation, and P red is the predicted accuracy
from Meta-DNN in subsequent k simulations. If a search
branch renders architectures similar to previously trained
good ones, Meta-DNN updates the exploitation term in Eq.1
to increase the likelihood of going to this branch.
Backpropagation back-tracks the search path from the
new node to the root to update visiting statistics. Please note
we discuss the sequential case here, and the backpropagation
will be split into two parts in the distributed setting (sec.3.5).

With the estimated q for the new node, we iteratively back-
propagate the information to its ancestral as:

Q(s, a) ← Q(s, a) + q , N (s, a) ← N (s, a) + 1
s ← parent(s),
a ← πtree (s)

until it reaches the root node.

3.3 The design of Meta-DNN and its related issues

Meta-DNN intends to generalize the performance of unseen
architectures based on previously sampled networks. It pro-
vides a practical solution to accurately estimate a search
branch with many simulations without involving the actual
training (see the metaDNN assisted simulation for details).
New training data is generated as AlphaX advances in the
search. So, the learning of Meta-DNN is end-to-end. The
input of Meta-DNN is a vector representation of architec-
ture, while the output is the prediction of architecture per-
formance, i.e. test accuracy.
The coding scheme for NASNet architectures is as fol-
lows: we use 6-digits vector to code a B lock ; the ﬁrst two
digits represent up to two layers in the left branch, and the
3rd and 4th digits for the right branch. Each layer is rep-
resented by a number in [1, 12] to represent 12 different
layers, and the speciﬁc layer code is available in Appendix
TABLE.4. We use 0 to pad the vector if a layer is absent.
The last two digits represent the input for the left and right
branch, respectively. For the coding of block inputs, 0 corre-
sponds to the output of the previous C ell, 1 is the previous,
previous C ell, and i + 2 is the output of B locki . If a block is
absent, it is [0,0,0,0,0,0]. The left part of Fig.4 demonstrates
an example of NASNet encoding scheme. A C ell has up to
5 blocks, so a vector of 60 digits is sufﬁcient to represent a
state that fully speciﬁes both RC ell and N C ell. The coding
scheme for NASBench architectures is a vector of ﬂat adja-
cency matrix, plus the nodelist. Similarly, we pad 0 if a layer
or an edge is absent. The right part of Fig.4 demonstrates an
example of NASBench encoding scheme. Since NASBench
limits nodes ≤ 7, 7×7 (adjacency matrix)+ 7 (nodelist) = 56
digits can fully specify a NASBench architecture.
Now we cast the prediction of architecture performance as
a regression problem. Finding a good metaDNN is heuristi-
cally oriented and it should vary from tasks to tasks. We cal-
culate the correlation between predicted accuracies and true
accuracies from the sampled architectures in evaluating the

design of metaDNN. Ideally, the metaDNN is expected to
rank an unseen architecture in roughly similar to its true test
accuracy, i.e. corr = 1. Various ML models, such as Gaus-
sian Process, Neural Networks, or Decision Tree, are candi-
dates for this regression task. We choose Neural Networks
as the backbone model for its powerful generalization on
the high-dimensional data and the online training capability.
More ablations studies for the speciﬁc choices of metaDNN
are available in sec.4.2.

3.4 Transfer Learning

As MCTS incrementally builds a network with primitive ac-
tions, networks falling on the same search path render simi-
lar structures. This motivates us to incorporate transfer learn-
ing in AlphaX to speed network evaluations up. In simula-
tion (Fig. 2), AlphaX recursively traverses up the tree to ﬁnd
a previously trained network with the minimal edit distance
to the newly sampled network. Then we transfer the weights
of overlapping layers, and randomly initialize new layers. In
the pre-training, we train every sample for 70 epochs if no
parent networks are transferable, and 20 epochs otherwise.
Fig. 11 provides a study to justify the design.

3.5 Distributed AlphaX

It is imperative to parallelize AlphaX to work on a large
scale distributed systems to tackle the computation chal-
lenges rendered by NAS. Fig.5 demonstrates the distributed
AlphaX. There is a master node exclusively for scheduling
the search, while there are multiple clients (GPU) exclu-
sively for training networks. The general procedures on the
server side are as follows: 1) The agent follows the selection
and expansion steps described in Fig.2. 2) The simulation in
MCTS picks a network archn for the actual training, and
the agent traverses back to ﬁnd the weights of parent archi-
tecture having the minimal edit distance to archn for trans-

est accuracy in the search.

fer learning; then we push both archn and parent weights
into a job queue. We deﬁne archn as the selected net-
work architecture at iteration n, and rollout− f rom(archn )
archn . 3) The agent preemptively backpropagates ˆq ←
as the node which it started the rollout from to reach
i=1..k P red(simi (s(cid:48) )) based only on predicted accura-
cies from the Meta-DNN at iteration n.

Q(s, a) ← Q(s, a) + ˆq , N (s, a) ← N (s, a) + 1,
s ← parent(s),
a ← πtree (s).

(4)

4) The server checks the receive buffer to retrieve a ﬁn-
ished job from clients that includes archz , accz . Then
the agent starts the second backpropagation to propagate
(Eq. 2) from the node the rollout started
(s ← rollout− f rom(archz )) to replace the backpropa-
gated ˆq with q :

q ← accz + ˆq

Q(s, a) ← Q(s, a) + q − ˆq ,
s ← parent(s),
a ← πtree (s).

(5)

The client constantly tries to retrieve a job from the mas-
ter job queue if it is free. It starts training once it gets the
job, then it transmits the ﬁnished job back to the server. So,
each client is a dedicated trainer. We also consider the fault-
tolerance by taking a snapshot of the server’s states every
few iterations, and AlphaX can resume the searching from
the breakpoint using the latest snapshot.

4.1 Evaluations of architecture search

Open domain search: we perform the search on CIFAR-10
using 8 NVIDIA 1080 TI. One GPU works as a server, while
the rest work as clients. To further speedup network evalu-
ations, we early terminated the training at 70th epoch dur-
ing the pre-training. We selected the top 20 networks from
the pre-training and ﬁne-tuned them additional 530 epochs
to get the ﬁnal accuracy. For the ImageNet training, we
constructed the network with the same RC ell and N C ell
searched on CIFAR10 following the accepted standard, i.e.
the mobile setting, deﬁned in (Zoph et al. 2017). In total,
AlphaX sampled 1000 networks; and Fig. 6 demonstrates
the architecture that yields the highest accuracy after ﬁne-
tuning. More details are available at appendix. C.
Table. 2 and Table. 3 and summarize SOTA results on
CIFAR10 and ImageNet, and AlphaX achieves SOTA ac-
curacy with the least samples (M). Our end-to-end search
cost, i.e. GPU days, is also on par with SOTA methods
due to the early terminating and transfer learning. Notably,
AlphaX achieves similar accuracy to AmoebaNet with 27x
fewer samples for the case with cutout and ﬁlters = 32. With-
out cutout and ﬁlters = 32, AlphaX outperforms NAONet by
0.14% in the test error with 16.7x fewer GPU days.

ple efﬁciency, we evaluate AlphaX on the recent NAS
dataset, NASBench-101 (Ying et al. 2019). NASBench enu-
merates all the possible DAGs of nodes ≤ 7, constituting
of (420k+) networks and their ﬁnal test accuracies. This en-
ables bypassing the computation barrier to fairly evaluate
the sample efﬁciency. In our experiments, we limited the
maximal nodes in a DAG ≤ 6, i.e. constructing a subset of
NASBench-101 that contains 64521 valid networks. This al-
lows us to quickly repeat each algorithm for 200 trials. The
search target is the network with the highest mean test ac-
curacy (the global optimum) at 108th epochs, which can be
known ahead by querying the dataset. We choose Random
Search (RS) (Sciuto et al. 2019) and Regularized Evolu-
tion (RE) (Real et al. 2018) as the baseline, as RE deliv-
ers competitive results according to Table. 2 in the NASNet
search space, and RS ﬁnds the global optimal in expected
n/2, where n is the dataset size.
Fig. 7 demonstrates AlphaX is 2.8x and 3x faster than RE
and RS, respectively. As we analyzed in Fig. 1, Random
Search lacks an online model. Regularized Evolution only

mutates on top-k performing models, while MCTS explic-
itly builds a search tree to dynamically trade off the explo-
ration and exploitation at individual states. Please note that
the slight difference in Fig. 7a actually reﬂects a huge gap in
speed as indicated by Fig. 7b. From Fig. 8, it shows there are
abundant architectures with minor performance difference to
the global optimum. Therefore, it is fast to ﬁnd the top 5%
architectures, while slow in reaching the global optimum.

Qualitative evaluations of AlphaX: Several interesting

insights are observable in Fig.9. 1) MCTS invests more on
the promising directions (high-value path), and less other-
wise (low-value path). Unlike greedy based algorithms, e.g.
hill-climbing, MCTS consistently explores the search space
guided by the adaptive UCT. 2) the best performing network
is not necessarily located on the most promising branch,
highlighting the importance of exploration in NAS.

4.2 Component evaluations

Meta-DNN Design and its Impact: The metric in evaluat-

ing metaDNN is the correlation between the predicted v.s.
true accuracy. We used 80% NASBench for training, and
20% for testing. Since DNNs have shown great success in
modeling complex data, we start with Multilayer Perceptron
(MLP) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) on building
the regression model. Speciﬁc architecture details are avail-
able in appendix.E. Fig. 10b and Fig .10d demonstrate the
performance of MLP (corr=0.784) is 4% better than RNN
(corr=0.743), as the MLP (Fig. 10c) performs much better
than RNN (Fig. 10a) in the training set. However, MLP still
mispredicts many networks around 0.1, 0.4 and 0.6 and 0.8
(x-axis) as shown in Fig. 10d. This clustering effect is con-
sistent with the architecture distribution in Fig. 8 for having
many networks around these accuracies. To alleviate this is-
sue, we propose a multi-stage model, the core idea of which
is to have several dedicated MLPs to predict different ranges

of accuracies, e.g. [0, 25%], along with another MLP to
predict which MLP to use in predicting the ﬁnal accuracy.
Fig. 10f shows a multi-stage model successfully improves
the correlation by 1.2% from MLP, and the mispredictions
have been greatly reduced. Since the multi-stage model has
achieved corr = 1 on the training set, we choose it as the
backbone regression model for AlphaX. Fig. 7 demonstrates
our meta-DNN is effective to sustain NAS.
Transfer Learning: the transfer learning signiﬁcantly
speeds network evaluations up, and Fig. 11 empirically val-
idates the effectiveness of transfer learning. We randomly
sampled an architecture as the parent network. On the par-
ent network, we added a block with two new 5x5 separable
conv layers on the left and right branch as the child network.
We trained the parent network toward 70 epochs and saved
its weights. In training the child network, we used weights
from the parent network in initializing the child network ex-
cept for two new conv layers that are randomly initialized.

tently the fastest algorithm to reach the global optimal on

Climbing can easily trap into a local optimal.

Fig. 11 shows the accuracy progress of transferred child net-
work at different training epochs. The transferred child net-
work retains the same accuracy as training from scratch (ran-
dom initialization) with much fewer epochs, but insufﬁcient
epochs lose the accuracy. Therefore, we chose 20 epochs in
pre-training an architecture if transfer learning applied.

4.3 Algorithm Comparisons

Fig. 12 evaluates MCTS against Q-Learning (QL), Hill
Climbing (HC) and Random Search (RS) on a simpliﬁed
search space. Setup details and the introduction of the de-
sign domain are available in appendix.D. These algorithms
are widely used in NAS (Baker et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2017b;
Elsken, Metzen, and Hutter 2017; Greff et al. 2017). We
conduct 10 trials for each algorithm. Fig. 12b demonstrates
AlphaX is 2.3x faster than QL and RS. Though HC is the
fastest, Fig. 12a indicates HC traps into a local optimal. In-
terestingly, Fig. 12b indicates the inter-quartile range of QL
is longer than RS. This is because QL quickly converges to a
suboptimal, spending a huge time to escape. This is consis-
tent with Fig. 12a that QL converges faster than RS before
the 50th samples, but random can easily escape from the lo-
cal optimal afterward. Fig. 12b (MCTS v.s. AlphaX) further
corroborates the effectiveness of meta-DNN.

Improved Features for Vision Applications

CNN is a common component for Computer Vision (CV)
models. Here, we demonstrate the searched architecture can
improve a variety of downstream Computer Vision (CV) ap-
plications. Please check the Appendix Sec.F for the experi-
ment setup.
1) Neural Style Transfer: AlphaX-1 is better than a shal-
low network (VGG) in capturing the rich details and textures
of a sophisticated style image (Fig. 13).
2) Object Detection: We replace MobileNet-v1 with
AlphaX-1 in SSD (Liu et al. 2016) object detection model,
and the mAP (mini-val) increases from 20.1% to 23.7% at
the 300 × 300 resolution. (Fig.16, appendix).
3) Image Captioning: we replace the VGG with AlphaX-
1 in show attend and tell (Xu et al. 2015). On the 2014
MSCOCO-val dataset, AlphaX-1 outperforms VGG by
2.4 (RELU-2), 4.4 (RELU-3), 3.7 (RELU-4), respectively
(Fig.17, appendix).

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a new MCTS based NAS agent
named AlphaX. Compared to prior MCTS agents, AlphaX
is the ﬁrst practical MCTS based agent that achieves SOTA
results on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet in a reasonable
amount of computations by improving the sampling efﬁ-
ciency with a novel predictive model meta-DNN, and by
amortizing the network evaluation costs with a scalable
solution and transfer learning. In 3 search tasks, AlphaX
consistently demonstrates superior search efﬁciency over
mainstream algorithms, highlighting MCTS as a promising
search algorithm for NAS.

a client-server communication protocol to send an architec-

describes the procedures of client that consistently listen

B Details of the State and Action Space

This section describes the state and action space for NASNet
design space.
We constrain the state space to make the design problem
manageable. The state space exponentially grows with the
depth: a k layers linear network has nk architecture varia-
tions, where n is the number of layer types. We leverage the
GPU DRAM size, our current computing resources and the
design heuristics from leading DNNs, to propose the follow-
ing constraints on the state space: 1) a branch has at most 1
layer; 2) a cell has at most 5 blocks; 3) the depth of blocks
is limited to 2; 5) we use layers listed in TABLE.4.
Actions also preserve the constraints imposed on the state
space. If the next state reaches out of the design boundary,
the agent automatically removes the action from the action
set. For example, we exclude the ”adding a new layer” action
for a branch if it already has 1 layer. So, the action set is
dynamically changing w.r.t states.

C Experiment Setup for Section 4.1

C.1 Setup for searching networks on NASBench

Regularized Evolution: our implementation of Regularized
Evolution (Real et al. 2018) is from 8 . The population size
is set to 500 to ﬁnd the global optimum, and the tournament
size is 50. We only mutate the best architecture in the tourna-
ment set and replace the oldest individual in the population.
We terminate the search once it ﬁnds the best architecture on
NASBench.
AlphaX : the only modiﬁcation for AlphaX on NASBench
is at the network training that queries an architecture per-
formance instead of training. c in Eq. 1 is set to 2, and the
number of predictions from meta-DNN is set to 10. The de-
sign and setup of meta-DNN are described in Sec. 4.2 and
Sec. E.

C.2 Setup for searching networks on CIFAR

We used 8 NV-1080ti gpus for the open domain search. One
GPU serves as the dedicated server, while the remaining
gpus are clients for training the architectures sent from the
server. The setup details are as follows: 1) we early termi-
nate the training at the 70th epoch, then rank networks to get
top-10 architectures. We trained an additional 530 epochs on
top-10 architectures to get their ﬁnal accuracy; 2) we applied
cutout (Zoph et al. 2017) during the training, and the cutout
uses 1 crop of size 16 × 16; 3) we applied cosine annealing
learning rate schedule (Loshchilov and Hutter 2017) in the

8 https://github.com/google-research/nasbench
/blob/master/NASBench.ipynb

training, and the base learning rate is 0.025, the batch size
is 96; 4) we used the momentum optimizer with momentum
rate set to 0.9 and L2 weight decay; 5) we use dropout ra-
tio schedule in the training. The droppath ratio is set to 0.3
and dense dropout ratio is set to 0.2 for searching procedure
and applied ScheduleDropPath (Zoph et al. 2017) for the ﬁ-
nal training; 6) we use an auxiliary classiﬁer located at 2/3
of depth of the network. The loss of the auxiliary classiﬁer
is weighted by 0.4 (Szegedy et al. 2015). 7) the weights of
architecture are initialized with Gaussian distribution with
µ = 0 and σ = 0.01. 8) we randomly crop 32x32 patches
from upsampled images of size 40 × 40, and apply random
horizontal ﬂips (Zoph et al. 2017).

C.3 Setup for ImageNet

The setup for training AlphaX-1 toward ImageNet are as
follows: 1) we construct the network for ImageNet with
searched RC ell and N C ell according to Fig. 6 in (Zoph et
al. 2017); 2) the input image size is 224× 224; 3) our models
for ImageNet use polynomial learning rate schedule, start-
ing with 0.05 and decay through 200 epochs; 4) we use the
momentum optimizer with momentum rate set to 0.9; 6) the
dropout rate at the the ﬁnal dense layer is 0.5; 7) the weights
of an architecture are initialized with Gaussian distribution

with µ = 0 and σ = 0.01.

D Experiment Setup for Section 4.3

The state space consists of sequential ConvNet, e.g. AlexNet
or VGG. The possible hyper-parameters of a convolution
layer are stride ∈ [1, 2], ﬁlters ∈ [32, 64], and kernels ∈
[2, 4], and the maximum depth of a ConvNet is set to 3. The
ﬁnal layer of a ConvNet is always a dense layer followed by
a softmax.
The possible actions are 1) adding a convolution layer; 2)
choosing/changing an activation for a convolution layer; 3)
changing a hyper-parameter of a convolution layer, e.g. ﬁl-
ters from 32 to 64. At any state, the action set also consists
of a special terminal action with a ﬁxed probability that sig-
nals MCTS, random, and Q-learning to terminate the current
search episode.
Random: the agent randomly selects actions, and termi-
nates the search once it hits a terminal action. Then the agent
trains the network represented by the state where it hits the
terminal to report accuracy.
Q-learning: we used tabular Q-learning agent with -
greedy strategy. The learning rate is set to 0.2, and the dis-
count factor is 1. We ﬁxed  to 0.2, and initialized the Q-
value with 0.5.

tiple MLP models. The
structure of
an MLP is

as
shown
by Fig.14b.
The setup for training a MLP are: 1) the training lasts 20
epochs on currently collected samples; 2) the learning rate
is set to 0.00002 in an Adam optimizer and the batch size is
128; 4) we uniformly initialize the network in the range of
[-0.1, 0.1].

F Setup for Vision Models

We use AlphaX-1 model pre-trained on ImageNet dataset as
the backbone. The training dataset is MSCOCO for object
jects. Each image is scaled to 300 × 300 in RGB channels.

We trained the model with 200k iterations with 0.04 initial
learning rate and the batch size is set to 24. We applied the
exponential learning rate decay schedule with the 0.95 de-
cay factor. Our model uses momentum optimizer with mo-
mentum rate set to 0.9. We also use the L2 weight decay
for training. We process each image with random horizontal
ﬂip and random crop (Liu et al. 2016). We set the matched
threshold to 0.5, which means only the probability of an ob-
ject over 0.5 is effective to appear on the image. We use 8000
subsets of validation images in MSCOCO validation set and
report the mean average precision (mAP) as computed with
the standard COCO metric library (Lin et al. 2014b).

F.2 Neural style

We implement the neural style transfer application by re-
placing the VGG model to AlplaX-1 model (Gatys, Ecker,

Hill Climbing: the agent trains every architecture in the
child nodes, and greedily chooses the next child node in a
fashion similar to PNAS (Liu et al. 2017a). We terminated
the search once it sticks into a local optimum, and restarted
the process at different random states.

E MetaDNN Designs and Setup

E.1 Setup for the RNN based meta-DNN

The detailed conﬁgurations of LSTM based meta-DNN are
as follows. The hidden state size is 100, and the embed-
ding size is 100. The ﬁnal LSTM hidden state goes through
a fully-connected layer to get the ﬁnal validation accuracy.
Fig.14a shows the architecture of the RNN predictor.
The setup for the RNN training are: 1) the training lasts
20 epochs on currently collected samples; 2) the base learn-
ing rate is 0.00002 and the batch size is 128; 3) we use the
Adam optimizer for the training; 4) we uniformly initialize
the network in the range of [-0.1, 0.1].

and Bethge 2015). AlplaX-1 model is pre-trained on Ima-
geNet dataset. In order to produce a nice result, we set the
total 1000 iterations with 0.1 learning rate. We set 10 as
the style weight which represents the extent of style recon-
struction and 0.025 as the content weight which represents
the extent of content reconstruction. We test different kinds
of combinations of the outputs of different layers. Fig. 15
shows the structure of AlphaX model, we found that for
AlphaX-1 model, the best result can be generated by the
concat layer of 13th normal cell as the feature for content
reconstruction and the concat layer in ﬁrst reduction cell as
the feature for style reconstruction, the types of layers in
each cell are shown in Fig. 6.

F.3

Image captioning

The training dataset of image captioning is MSCOCO (Lin
et al. 2014a), a large-scale dataset for the object detec-
tion, segmentation, and captioning. Each image is scaled to
224 × 224 in RGB channels and subtract the channel means
as the input to a AlphaX-1 model. For training AlphaX-1
model, We use the SGD optimizer with the 16 batch size
and the initial learning rate is 2.0. We applied the exponen-
tial learning rate decay schedule with the 0.5 decay factor in
every 8 epochs.
