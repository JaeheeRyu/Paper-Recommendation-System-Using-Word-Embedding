Abstract

We consider the problem of minimizing a convex risk with stochastic subgradients
guaranteeing -locally differentially private (-LDP). While it has been shown that
stochastic optimization is possible with -LDP via the standard SGD (Song et al.,
2013), its convergence rate largely depends on the learning rate, which must be
tuned via repeated runs. Further, tuning is detrimental to privacy loss since it
signiﬁcantly increases the number of gradient requests. In this work, we propose
BANCO (Betting Algorithm for Noisy COins), the ﬁrst -LDP SGD algorithm that
essentially matches the convergence rate of the tuned SGD without any learning
rate parameter, reducing privacy loss and saving privacy budget.

Introduction

In this paper, we consider the problem of minimizing the convex risk of a machine learning predic-
tor, guaranteeing local differential privacy. Instead of going through the empirical risk minimization
route, we directly optimize the stochastic objective of the risk via stochastic subgradients appropri-
ately sanitized to guarantee the local differential privacy. Our proposed algorithm is a variant of
stochastic subgradient descent, with the important feature of not requiring the tuning of learning
rates. Yet, it guarantees the same convergence rate and local differential privacy of a stochastic

subgradient descent procedure with the oracle tuning of its learning rate.
(cid:96)(w, x) is convex in the ﬁrst argument and x represents sensitive data about an individual drawn
i.i.d. from ρX . In machine learning terms, R(w) represents the test loss that we are interested
in directly minimizing, while (cid:96)(w , x) is the loss on a single sample x. It is well-known that, by
linearity of the expectation, we can get an unbiased estimate of a subgradient of R(w) just using
a subgradient w.r.t. the ﬁrst argument of (cid:96)(⋅, x) where x is drawn i.i.d. from ρX . Hence, we can
construct sanitized subgradients simply returning a noisy version G (w) ∈ ∂ (cid:96)(w , x) + ξ where the
noise ξ guarantees the -Local Differential Privacy (-LDP), which prevents the private information
(SGD) algorithm together with the popular choice of density p(ξ) ∝ exp(− 
from being identiﬁed. We elaborate more on the problem deﬁnition and the assumptions in Section 2.

beforehand. Therefore, practitioners need to tune the learning rate by trying out various values over
multiple runs. However, this signiﬁcantly increases the number of subgradient requests, which can

Related work. While there is a large body of work on differentially private (DP) empirical risk
minimization, there is less research on studying the generalization properties of the obtained solu-
tion. Moreover, most of the work is based on the notion of differential privacy rather than on the
stronger notion of local differential privacy (LDP). We remind the readers that the DP is useful when
the data provider trusts the learning agents to be DP and allows them to access sensitive data (or data
provider may possess the learners internally) whereas LDP is useful when the data provider does not
trust the learning agents and thus have to release sanitized version of individual data. Due to space
constraints, we focus on discussing the most relevant works. The notion of LDP was introduced in
Duchi et al. (2014) and Song et al. (2013; 2015). Duchi et al. (2014) study the generalization of lo-
cally differentially private SGD, focusing on the optimal dependency on the number of dimensions,
but assuming bounded domains to optimally tune the learning rates. Song et al. (2013; 2015) use lo-
cally differentially private SGD to minimize the regularized ERM problems. Wu et al. (2017) study
the convergence of SGD to minimize the ERM problem and guarantee differential privacy through
the output perturbation method, and they also require the knowledge of the norm of the optimal so-
lution to optimally tune the learning rates. Bassily et al. (2014) studies the generalization properties
of locally differentially private SGD, but it requires a bounded domain to set the learning rates or
the presence of a regularizer, that in turn must be tuned. Instead, our work gives a generalization
guarantee for a locally differentially private SGD with one pass over the data and no learning rates
to tune.
The problem of parameter-free -LDP SGD can be seen as a noisy version of the parameter-free
SGD problem (Streeter and McMahan, 2012; Orabona and Pal, 2016; Orabona and Tommasi, 2017;
Cutkosky and Orabona, 2018). However, the extension of existing (near-optimal) parameter-free
SGDs to noisy gradients is not immediately clear since the noise makes the gradients unbounded
while the parameter-free SGDs require bounded gradients. Speciﬁcally, naively feeding in the un-
bounded gradients can even make the algorithm undeﬁned, let alone the lack of convergence guaran-
tees; see (Jun and Orabona, 2019, Section 3) for a detailed argument. Our solution in this paper goes
back to the more general version of Online Convex Optimization (OCO) (Zinkevich, 2003) and re-
consider its formulation to allow unbounded noise, which is more general than the -LDP setting. In
this paper, however, we focus on the LDP setting; we refer the interested readers to Jun and Orabona
(2019).

2 Problem Deﬁnition and Preliminaries

In this section, we describe our notations and provide relevant background.
Locally Differentially Private (LDP) SGD. An -differentially private algorithm must guarantee
that the log-likelihood ratio of the outputs of the algorithm under two databases differing in a single
individual’s data is smaller than  (Dwork et al., 2006). In the stricter deﬁnition of local differen-
tial privacy (LDP) (Wasserman and Zhou, 2010; Kasiviswanathan et al., 2011; Duchi et al., 2014;

We now describe BANCO that achieves essentially the convergence rate of optimally-tuned SGD
without repeated runs for tuning the learning rate, thus being truly one-pass. BANCO decomposes
the optimization process into two parts: one for optimizing the direction and the other for the mag-
nitude of the solution vector. For the direction, we use projected stochastic gradient descent with
adaptive learning rates (Orabona and P ´al, 2018). While, for the magnitude we use a parameter-
free algorithm based on coin-betting (Orabona and Pal, 2016; Jun and Orabona, 2019). We then
construct the solution vector as the multiplication of the two solutions. The full pseudocode can
be found in Algorithm 1. Note that mt+1 has a closed form solution as follows: with shorthands

The proof is mainly concerned with regret, a standard quantity in online learning that measures the
suboptimality with an arbitrary comparator u. Theorem 2 is a direct consequence of the expected
regret bound we describe below using so-called the online-to-batch conversion (Cesa-Bianchi et al.,
2004). Theorem 3 below shows that the expected regret of Algorithm 1 is decomposed into two
expected regrets, each for the magnitude learner mt and the direction learner q t . The fact that

from tuning its learning rate, delegating the burden of adaptation to the magnitude learner. In turn,
we consider linear functions that can be written as (cid:96)(w, x) = −g t , w for some g t without loss of

For the direction learner, one can invoke any algorithm that guarantees the optimal regret with re-
