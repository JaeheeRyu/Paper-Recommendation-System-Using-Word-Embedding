Abstract

Conditional generative adversarial networks have shown ex-
ceptional generation performance over the past few years.
However, they require large numbers of annotations. To ad-
dress this problem, we propose a novel generative adversarial
network utilizing weak supervision in the form of pairwise
comparisons (PC-GAN) for image attribute editing. In the
light of Bayesian uncertainty estimation and noise-tolerant
adversarial training, PC-GAN can estimate attribute rating ef-
ﬁciently and demonstrate robust performance in noise resis-
tance. Through extensive experiments, we show both qualita-
tively and quantitatively that PC-GAN performs comparably
with fully-supervised methods and outperforms unsupervised
baselines. Code can be found on the project website∗ .

Introduction

Generative adversarial networks (GAN) (Goodfellow et al.
2014) have shown great success in producing high-quality
realistic imagery by training a set of networks to gener-
ate images of a target distribution via an adversarial set-
ting between a generator and a discriminator. New architec-
tures have also been developed for adversarial learning such
as conditional GAN (CGAN) (Mirza and Osindero 2014;
Odena, Olah, and Shlens 2016; Han, Murphy, and Ramanan
2018) which feeds a class or an attribute label for a model to
learn to generate images conditioned on that label. The su-
perior performance of CGAN makes it favorable for many
problems in artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) such as image at-
tribute editing.
However, this task faces a major challenge from the lack
of massive labeled images with varying attributes. Many re-
cent works attempt to alleviate such problems using semi-
supervised or unsupervised conditional image synthesis (Lu-
cic et al. 2019). These methods mainly focus on condi-
tioning the model on categorical pseudo-labels using self-
supervised image feature clustering. However, attributes are
often continuous-valued, for example, the stroke thickness
of MNIST digits. In such cases, applying unsupervised clus-
tering would be difﬁcult since features are most likely to
be grouped by salient attributes (like identities) rather than
any other attributes of interest. In this work, to disentangle

the target attribute from the rest, we focus on learning from
weak supervisions in the form of pairwise comparisons.
Pairwise comparisons. Collecting human preferences on
pairs of alternatives, rather than evaluating absolute indi-
vidual intensities, is intuitively appealing, and more im-
portantly, supported by evidence from cognitive psychol-
ogy (F ¨urnkranz and H ¨ullermeier 2010). As pointed out
by Yan (2016), we consider relative attribute annotation be-
cause they are (1) easier to obtain than total orders, (2) more
accurate than absolute attribute intensities, and (3) more re-
liable in application like crowd-sourcing. For example, it
would be hard for an annotator to accurately quantify the
attractiveness of a person’s look, but much easier to decide
which one is preferred given two candidates. Moreover, at-
tributes in images are often subjective. Different annotators
have different criteria in their mind, which leads to noisy
annotations (Xu et al. 2019).
Thus, instead of assigning an absolute attribute value
to an image, we allow the model to learn to rank and
assign a relative order between two images (Yan 2016;
F ¨urnkranz and H ¨ullermeier 2010). This method alleviates
the aforementioned problem of lacking continuously valued
annotations by learning to rank using pairwise comparisons.

Weakly supervised GANs. Our main idea is to substitute
the full supervision with the attribute ratings learned from
weak supervisions, as illustrated in Figure 1. To do so, we
draw inspiration from the Elo rating system (Elo 1978) and
design a Bayesian Siamese network to learn a rating function
with uncertainty estimations. Then, for image synthesis, mo-

tivated by (Thekumparampil et al. 2018) we use “corrupted”
labels for adversarial training. The proposed framework can
(1) learn from pairwise comparisons, (2) estimate the uncer-
tainty of predicted attribute ratings, and (3) offer quantitative
controls in the presence of a small portion of absolute anno-
tations. Our contributions can be summarized as follows.
• We propose a weakly supervised generative adversarial
network, PC-GAN, from pairwise comparisons for image
attribute manipulation. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the ﬁrst GAN framework considering relative attribute
orders.
• We use a novel attribute rating network motivated from
the Elo rating system, which models the latent score un-
derlying each item and tracks the uncertainty of the pre-
dicted ratings.
• We extend the robust conditional GAN to continuous-
value setting, and show that the performance can be
boosted by incorporating the predicted uncertainties from
the rating network.
• We analyze the sample complexity which shows that this
weakly supervised approach can save annotation effort.
Experimental results show that PC-GAN is competitive
with fully-supervised models, while surpassing unsuper-
vised methods by a large margin.

Related Work

Learning to rank. Our work focuses on ﬁnding “scores”
for each item (e.g. player’s rating) in addition to obtaining a
ranking. The popular Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model pos-
tulates a set of latent scores underlying all items, and the Elo
system corresponds to the logistic variant of the BTL model.
Numerous algorithms have been proposed since then. To
name a few, TrueSkill (Herbrich, Minka, and Graepel 2007)
considers a generalized Elo system in the Bayesian view.
Rank Centrality (Negahban, Oh, and Shah 2016) builds on
spectral ranking and interprets the scores as the stationary
probability under the random walk over comparison graphs.
However, these methods are not designed for amortized in-
ference, i.e. the model should be able to score (or extrapo-
late) an unseen item for which no comparisons are given.
Apart from TrueSkill and Rank Centrality, the most rele-
vant work is the RankNet (Burges et al. 2005). Despite be-
ing amortized, RankNet is homoscedastic and falls short of
a principled justiﬁcation as well as providing uncertainty es-
timations.

Weakly supervised learning. Weakly-supervised learning

focuses on learning from coarse annotations. It is useful
because acquiring annotations can be very costly. A close
weakly supervised setting to our problem is (Xiao and
Jae Lee 2015) which learns the spatial extent of relative at-
tributes using pairwise comparisons and gives an attribute
intensity estimation. However, most facial attributes like at-
tractiveness and age are not localized features thus cannot
be exploited by local regions. In contrast, our work uses this
relative attribute intensity for attribute transfer and manipu-
lation.
Uncertainty. There are two uncertainty measures one can
model: aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. The

epistemic uncertainty captures the variance of model pre-
dictions caused by lack of sufﬁcient data; the aleatoric
uncertainty represents the inherent noise underlying the
data (Kendall and Gal 2017). In this work, we leverage
Bayesian neural networks (Gal and Ghahramani 2016) as
a powerful tool to model uncertainties in the Elo rating net-
work.

Robust conditional GAN (RCGAN). Conditioning on the

estimated ratings, a normal conditional generative model can
be vulnerable under bad estimations. To this end, recent re-
search introduces noise robustness to GANs. Bora, Price,
and Dimakis (2018) apply a differentiable corruption to the
output of the generator before feeding it into the discrim-
inator. Similarly, RCGAN (Thekumparampil et al. 2018)
proposes to corrupt the categorical label for conditional
GANs and provides theoretical guarantees. Both methods
have shown great denoising performance when noisy ob-
servations are present. To address our problem, we extend
RCGAN to the continuous-value setting and incorporate un-
certainties to guide the image generation.

Image attribute editing. There are many recent GAN-

style architectures focusing on image attribute editing. IPC-
GAN (Wang et al. 2018b) proposes an identity preserving
loss for facial attribute editing. Zhu et al. (2017) propose
cycle consistency loss that can learn the unpaired transla-
tion between image and attribute. BiGAN/ALI (Donahue,
Kr ¨ahenb ¨uhl, and Darrell 2016; Dumoulin et al. 2016) learns
an inverse mapping between image-and-attribute pairs.
There exists another line of research that is not GAN-
based. Deep feature interpolation (DFI) (Upchurch et al.
2017) relies on linear interpolation of deep convolutional
features. It is also weakly-supervised in the sense that it re-
quires two domains of images (e.g. young or old) with inex-
act annotations (Zhou 2017). DFI demonstrates high-ﬁdelity
results on facial style transfer. While, the generated pixels
look unnatural when the desired attribute intensity takes ex-
treme values, we also ﬁnd that DFI cannot control the at-
tribute intensity quantitatively. Wang et al. (2018a) consid-
ers a binary setting and sets qualitatively the intensity of the
attribute. Unlike prior research, our method uses weak su-
pervision in the form of pairwise comparisons and leverages
uncertainty together with noise-tolerant adversarial learning
to yield a robust performance in image attribute editing.

Pairwise Comparison GAN

comparisons C (e.g., Ω (xi ) > Ω (xj ) or Ω (xi ) = Ω (xj ),

In this section, we introduce the proposed method for pair-
wise weakly-supervised visual attribute editing. Denote an
image collection as I = {x1 , · · · , xn} and xi ’s underlying
absolute attribute values as Ω (xi ). Given a set of pairwise
where i, j ∈ {1, · · · , n}), our goal is to generate a realistic
image quantitatively with a different desired attribute inten-
sity, for example, from 20 years old to 50 years old. The pro-
posed framework consists of an Elo rating network followed
by a noise-robust conditional GAN.

Attribute Rating Network

The designed attribute rating module is motivated by the Elo
rating system (Elo 1978), which is widely used to evalu-

ate the relative levels of skills between players in zero-sum
games. Elo rating from a player is represented as a scalar
value which is adjusted based on the outcome of games. We
apply this idea to image attribute editing by considering each
image as a player and comparison pairs as games with out-
comes. Then we learn a rating function.
Elo rating system. The Elo system assumes the perfor-
mance of each player is normally distributed. For exam-
ple, if Player A has a rating of yA and Player B
has a rating of yB , the probability of Player A winning
the game against Player B can be predicted by PA =
1+10(yB −yA )/400 . We use SA to denote the actual score that
Player A obtains after the game, which can be valued as

SA (win) = 1, SA (tie) = 0.5, SA (lose) = 0. After each

neural network for predicting the relative attribute relation-
ship between Ω(xA ) and Ω(xB ). This design allows amor-
tized inference, that is, the rating prediction network can
provide ratings for both seen and unseen data. The model
structure is illustrated in Figure 2.

rating value of x follows a normal distribution, that is
trick (Kingma and Welling 2013), yx = µ(x)+σ(x) (where
 ∼ N (0, I )). After obtaining each image’s latent rating

the predictive probability of xA winning xB is obtained by

We further consider a Bayesian variant of E . The Bayesian
neural network is shown to be able to provide the epistemic
uncertainty of the model by estimating the posterior over
network weights in network parameter training (Kendall
and Gal 2017) . Speciﬁcally, let qθ (w) be an approxi-
mation of the true posterior p(w|data) where θ denotes
qθ (w) and p(w|data) with the KL-divergence. The over-

work becomes a RankNet (Burges et al. 2005), and tran-
sitivity holds. However, one can still maintain transitiv-
ity by avoiding reparameterization and modeling PA =

eterization works better.

Conditional GAN with Noisy Information

We construct a CGAN-based framework for image synthe-
sis conditioned on the learned attribute rating. The overall
training procedure is shown in Figure 3: given a pair of im-
ages x and x(cid:48) , the generator G is trained to transform x
into ˜x(cid:48) = G (x, y (cid:48) ), such that ˜x(cid:48) possesses the same rating
y (cid:48) = E (x(cid:48) ) as x(cid:48) . The predicted ratings can still be noisy,
thus a robust conditional GAN is considered. While RC-
GAN (Thekumparampil et al. 2018) is conditioned on dis-
crete categorical labels that are “corrupted” by a confusion
matrix, our model relies on the ratings that are continuous-
valued and realizes the “corruption” via resampling.
Adversarial loss. Given image x, the corresponding rating
y can be obtained from a forward pass of the pre-trained

is a sampling process ˜y (cid:48) ∼ N (y (cid:48) , ˆσ (cid:48)2 ). The reconstruction on at-
tribute rating enforces mutual information maximization. The main
difference between PC-GAN and a normal conditional GAN is that
the conditioned rating of the generated sample is corrupted before
feeding into the adversarial discriminator, forcing the generator to
produce samples with clean ratings.

encoder E . Thus E deﬁnes a joint distribution pE (x, y) =
pdata (x)pE (y |x). Importantly, the output ˜x(cid:48) of G is paired
with a corrupted rating ˜y (cid:48) = T (y (cid:48) ), where T is a sampling
process ˜y (cid:48) ∼ N (y (cid:48) , ˆσ (cid:48)2 ). The adversarial loss is

LCGAN =Ex,y∼p(x,y) log(D(x, y)) +
Ex∼p(x),y (cid:48)∼p(y (cid:48) ), ˜y (cid:48)∼T (y (cid:48) ) log(1 − D(G (x, y (cid:48) ), ˜y (cid:48) )).

(6)

The discriminator D is discriminating between real data
(x, y) and generated data (G (x, y (cid:48) ), T (y (cid:48) )). At the same
time, G is trained to fool D by producing images that are
both realistic and consistent with the given attribute rating.
As such, the Bayesian variant of the encoder is required for
considering robust conditional adversarial training.

Mutual information maximization. Besides conditioning

the discriminator, to further encourage the generative pro-
cess to be consistent with ratings and thus learn a disentan-
gled representation (Chen et al. 2016), we add a reconstruc-
tion loss on the predictive ratings:

Ly

rec = Ex∼p(x),y (cid:48)∼p(y (cid:48) )

2 ˆσ (cid:48)2 (cid:107)E (G (x, y (cid:48) )) − y (cid:48)(cid:107)2

2 +

2

log ˆσ (cid:48)2 .

(7)
The above reconstruction loss can be viewed as the condi-
tional entropy between y (cid:48) and G (x, y (cid:48) ),

(cid:2)Ey∼(y | ˜x(cid:48) ) [log (y | ˜x(cid:48) )](cid:3)
rec ∝ −Ey (cid:48)∼p(y (cid:48) ), ˜x(cid:48)∼G (x,y (cid:48) ) [log p(y (cid:48) | ˜x(cid:48) )]

= −Ey (cid:48)∼p(y (cid:48) ), ˜x(cid:48)∼G (x,y (cid:48) )

Ly

= H(y (cid:48) |G (x, y (cid:48) )).

(8)
Thus, minimizing the reconstruction loss is equivalent to
maximizing the mutual information between the conditioned
rating and the output image.

the identity information. Following the same logic, the cycle
loss can be also viewed as maximizing the mutual informa-
tion between x and G (x, y (cid:48) ).
Full objective. Finally, the full objective can be written as:

where λs control the relative importance of corresponding

Analysis of loss functions. Goodfellow et al. (2014) show
that
the adversarial
training results in minimizing the
Jensen-Shannon divergence between the true conditional
and the generated conditional. Here, the approximated con-
ditional will converge to the distribution characterized by the
encoder E . If E is optimal, the approximated conditional will
converge to the true conditional, we defer the proof in Sup-
plementary.
GAN training. In practice, we ﬁnd that the conditional gen-
erative model trains better if equal-pairs (pairs with approxi-
mately equal attribute intensities) are ﬁltered out and only
different-pairs (pairs with clearly different intensities) are
remained. Comparisons of training CGAN with or without
equal-pairs can be found in Supplementary.

hard+diff stands for training Elo rating with hard examples
and training CGAN with different-pairs only, and pseudo-diff
stands for the pairs augmented with pseudo-pairs but with equal
pairs ﬁltered out. If the same active learning strategy is used (e.g.
rand+diff and rand+all), CGANs are conditioned on the
same ratings trained from all pairs (e.g. rand+all).

Pair Sampling

Active learning strategies such as OHEM (Shrivastava,
Gupta, and Girshick 2016) can be incorporated in our Elo
rating network. In hard example mining, only pairs with
small rating differences are queried (hard+diff/all in
Table 1). In addition, to maximize the number of different-
pairs we also try easy example mining (easy+diff/all
in Table 1). As shown, easy examples are inferior to hard
examples in terms of both rating correlations and image
qualities. The reason might be that easy example mining
chooses pairs with drastic differences in attribute inten-
sity, which makes the model hard to train. Hard examples
help to learn a better rating function, however, provide less

𝑦′𝑥𝑥(cid:3556)′𝑦(cid:3556)′𝑥𝑦𝒟reconstructionlossadversariallossℰ𝒢𝒯ℰ⋅amount of different-pairs for the generative model to cap-
ture attribute transitions. We therefore augment hard exam-
ples with pseudo-pairs (easy examples but with predicted la-
bels, listed as hard+pseudo-diff/all in Table 1). The
augmentation strategy works well, but in following experi-
ments we use randomly sampled pairs because (1) the ran-
dom strategy is simple and performs equally well, and (2)
pseudo-labels are less reliable than queried labels.
Number of pairs. Suppose there are n images in the dataset,
then the possible number of pairs is upper bounded by n(n−
1)/2. However, if O(n2 ) pairs are necessary, there is no ben-
eﬁt of choosing pairwise comparisons over absolute label
annotation. Using results from (Radinsky and Ailon 2011;
Wauthier, Jordan, and Jojic 2013), the following proposition
shows that only O(n) comparisons are needed to recover an
approximate ranking.
Proposition 0.1. For a constant d and any 0 < λ < 1,
if we measure dn/λ2 comparisons chosen uniformly with
repetition, the Elo rating network will output a permutation
ˆπ of expected risk at most (2/λ)(n(n − 1)/2).
We also provide an empirical study in the Supplementary
that supports the above proposition.

Experiments

In this section, we ﬁrst present a motivating experiment on
MNIST. Then we evaluate the PC-GAN in two parts: (1)
learning attribute ratings, and (2) conditional image synthe-
sis, both qualitatively and quantitatively.
Dataset. We evaluate PC-GAN on a variety of datasets for
image attribute editing tasks:
• Annotated MNIST (Kim 2017) provides annotations of
stroke thickness for MNIST (LeCun et al. 1998) dataset.
• CACD (Chen, Chen, and Hsu 2014) is a large dataset
collected for cross-age face recognition, which includes
2,000 subjects and 163,446 images. It contains multiple
images for each person which cover different ages.
• UTKFace (Zhang and Qi 2017) is also a large-scale face
dataset with a long age span, ranging from 0 to 116 years.

Figure 6: Results on UTKFace. The target attribute is age. Values
from Attr0 to Attr4 correspond to age of 10, 30, 50, 70 and 90,
respectively.

This dataset contains 23,709 facial images with annota-
tions of age, gender, and ethnicity.
• SCUT-FBP (Xie et al. 2015) is speciﬁcally designed for
facial beauty perception. It contains 500 Asian female
portraits with attractiveness ratings (1 to 5) labeled by 75
human raters.
• CelebA (Liu et al. 2015) is a standard large-scale dataset
for facial attribute editing. It consists of over 200k images,
annotated with 40 binary attributes.
For the MNIST experiment, stroke thickness is the desired
attribute. As illustrated in Figure 4-a, the thickness infor-
mation is still entangled. But in Figure 4-b, the thickness is
correctly disentangled from the rest attributes.
We use CACD and UTK for age progression, SCUT-FBP
and CelebA for attractiveness experiment. Since no true rel-
atively labeled dataset is publically available, pairs are sim-
ulated from “ground-truth” attribute intensity given in the
dataset. The tie margins within which two candidates are

Figure 7: Results on SCUT-FBP. The target attribute is attractive-
ness score (1 to 5). Values from Attr0 to Attr4 correspond to
score of 1.375, 2.125, 2.875, 3.625 and 4.5, respectively.

considered equal are 10, 10, and 0.4 for CACD, UTK, and
SCUT-FBP, respectively. This also simpliﬁes the quantita-
tive evaluation process since one can directly measure the
prediction error for absolute attribute intensities. Notice that
CelebA only provides binary annotations, from which pair-
wise comparisons are simulated. Interestingly, the Elo rat-
ing network is still able to recover approximate ratings from
those binary labels.
Furthermore, since CACD, UTKFace, SCUT-FBP, and
CelebA are all human face dataset, we add an identity pre-
serving loss term (Wang et al. 2018b) to enforce identity

Here, h(·) denotes a pre-trained convnet.
Implementation. PC-GAN is implemented using Py-
Torch (Paszke et al. 2017). Network architectures and train-
ing details are given in Supplementary. For a fair evaluation,
the basic modules are kept identical across all baselines.

preservation: Lidt = Ex∼p(x),y∼p(y) (cid:107)h(G (x, y)) − h(x)(cid:107)2

Figure 8: Results on CelebA. The target attribute is attractiveness.
We take the cluster mean of ratings for “attractive” being -1 and
1 as Attr0 and Attr4 respectively. Attr1 to Attr3 are then
linearly sampled. Results show a smooth transition of visual fea-
tures, for example, facial hair, aging related features, smile lines,
and shape of eyes.

Learning by Pairwise Comparison

Rating visualization. Figure 10 presents the predicted rat-
ings learned from CACD, UTKFace, and SCUT-FBP from
left to right. The ratings learned from pairwise comparisons
highly correlate with the ground-truth labels, which indi-
cates that the rating resembles the attribute intensity well.
The uncertainties v.s. ground-truth labels is visualized in
Figure 11. The plots show a general trend that the model
is more certain about instances with extreme attribute values
than those in the middle range, which matches our intuition.
Additional attention-based visualizations are given in Sup-
plementary.
Noise resistance. As mentioned previously, not only does
pairwise comparison require less annotating effort, it tends
to yield more accurate annotations. Consider a simple set-
ting:

cal study of the noise resistance of pairwise comparisons in
Supplementary.

Conditional Image Synthesis

Baselines. We consider two unsupervised baselines Cy-
cleGAN and BiGAN, two fully-supervised baselines Disc-
CGAN and Cont-CGAN, and DFI in a similar weakly-
supervised setting.
• CycleGAN (Zhu et al. 2017) learns an encoder (or a “gen-
erator” from images to attributes) and a generator between
images and attributes simultaneously.
• ALI/BiGAN(Donahue, Kr ¨ahenb ¨uhl, and Darrell 2016;
Dumoulin et al. 2016) learns the encoder (an inverse map-
ping) with a single discriminator.
• Disc-CGAN/IPCGAN (Wang et al. 2018b) takes dis-
cretized attribute intensities (one-hot embedding) as su-
pervision.

Figure 11: Visualization of the predictive uncertainty of learned
ratings for different datasets (best viewed in color). Aleatoric
(data-dependent) and epistemic (model-dependent) uncertainties
are plotted separately.

• Cont-CGAN uses the same CGAN framework as PC-
GAN but ratings are replaced by true labels. It is an upper
bound of PC-GAN.
• DFI (Upchurch et al. 2017) can control the intensity of
attribute intensity continuously, however, cannot change
the intensity quantitatively. To transform x into ˜x(cid:48) , we as-

sume φ( ˜x(cid:48) ) = φ(x) + αw and compute y (cid:48) = w · φ(x(cid:48) )
(y (cid:48) − w · φ(x))/(cid:107)w(cid:107)2

(w is the attribute vector), then α is given by α =
2 .
Qualitative results. In Figure 9, we compare our results
with all baselines. For each row, we take a source and a
target image as inputs and our goal is to edit the attribute
value of the source image to be equal to that of the target
image. PC-GAN is competitive with fully-supervised base-
lines while all unsupervised methods fail to change attribute
intensities.
More results are shown in Figure 5, 7, 6, where the tar-
get rating value is the average of (cluster mean) a batch
of (10 to 50) labeled images. From Figure 5, we see ag-

well learned. Figure 6 shows convincing indications of re-
juvenation and age progression. Figure 7 shows results for
SCUT-FBP, which is inherently challenging because of the
size of the dataset. Compared to datasets such as CACD,
SCUT-FBP is signiﬁcantly smaller, with only 500 images
in total (from which we take 400 for training). Training on
large datasets, as the CelebA experiment in Figure 8 shows,
our model produces convincing results. We also ﬁnd that the
model is capable of learning important patterns that corre-
spond to attractiveness, such as in the hairstyle and the shape
of the cheek shown in Figure 7. (The result does not repre-
sent the authors’ opinion of attractiveness, but only reﬂects
the statistics of the annotations.)
Quantitative results. For quantitative evaluations, we re-
port in Table 2 classiﬁcation accuracy (Acc) evaluated on
synthesized images. In our experiments, we train classi-
ﬁers to predict attribute intensities of images into discrete
groups (CACD 11-20, 21-30, up to > 50; UTK 1-20, 21-40,
up to > 80, SCUT-FBP 1-1.75, 1.75-2.5, up to > 4).
PC-GAN demonstrates comparable performance with fully-
supervised baselines and are signiﬁcantly better than un-
supervised methods. Additional metrics are reported in the
Supplementary.
AMT user studies. We also conduct user study experiments.
Workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) are asked
to rate the quality of each face (good or bad) and vote to
which age group a given image belongs. Then we calculate
the percentage of images rated as good and the classiﬁcation
accuracy. Table 5 shows that PC-GAN is on a par with the
fully-supervised counterparts. We conduct hypothesis test-
ing of PC-GAN and Disc-CGAN for image quality rating,
p-value = 0.31, which indicates they are not statistically
different with 95% conﬁdence level.

Ablation Studies

Supervision. First, the comparisons in Table 2 serve as an
ablation study of full, no, and weak supervision, where PC-
GAN is on a par with fully-supervised and signiﬁcantly bet-
ter than unsupervised baselines.
GAN loss terms. Second, an ablation study of CGAN loss
terms is provided in Table 3. Notice that setting some losses
to zero is a special case of our full objective under different
λs. Although we did not extensively tune λ’s values since it
is not the main focus of this paper, we conclude that Lrec is
the most important term in terms of image qualities.
Uncertainty. The ablation study of the effectiveness of
adding Bayesian uncertainties to achieve robust conditional
adversarial training is given in Table 4. The three variants

considered in the table differ in how much the Bayesian neu-
ral net is involved in the whole training pipeline: CNN-CGAN
is a non-Bayesian Elo rating network plus a normal CGAN,
BNN-CGAN learns a Bayesian encoder and yields the aver-
age ratings for a given image, and BNN-RCGAN trains a full
Bayesian encoder with a noise-robust CGAN. Results con-
ﬁrm that the performance can be boosted by integrating an
uncertainty-aware Elo rating network and an extended ro-
bust conditional GAN.

Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a noise-robust conditional GAN
framework under weak supervision for image attribute edit-
ing. Our method can learn an attribute rating function and
estimate the predictive uncertainties from pairwise compar-
isons, which requires less annotation effort. We show in ex-
tensive experiments that the proposed PC-GAN performs
competitively with the supervised baselines and signiﬁcantly
outperforms the unsupervised baselines.

Supplementary

In Supplementary, we ﬁrst show the analysis of CGAN loss
terms and give a proof of Proposition 0.1. Then we provide
an empirical study of how the number of pairs varies with
the size of the dataset. The preliminary results on noise resis-
tance is also presented. Next, we show qualitative attention
visualization of the Elo rating network and report additional
quantitative IS and FID scores for baselines and list details
of network architectures. Finally, we show additional results
on conditional image synthesis.

Analysis of Loss Terms

As a standard recall in (Goodfellow et al. 2014), the ad-
versarial training results in minimizing the Jensen-Shannon
divergence between the true conditional and the generated
conditional. We show that the following proposition holds:
Proposition .2. The global minimum of L(G , D) is achieved
if and only if qG ( ˜x(cid:48) |x, y (cid:48) ) = pE ( ˜x(cid:48) |x, y (cid:48) ), where p is the true
distribution and qG is the distribution induced by G .
Proof. (x(cid:48) , y (cid:48) ) is sampled from true distribution, x is in-
dependently sampled and ˜x(cid:48) is sampled from Generator
G(x, y (cid:48) ), rewrite Equation 5 in integral form,

p(x)pE (y (cid:48) )qG ( ˜x(cid:48) |x, y (cid:48) ) log(1 − D( ˜x(cid:48) , y (cid:48) ))dxdy (cid:48)d ˜x(cid:48)
pE (x, ˜x(cid:48) , y (cid:48) ) log(D( ˜x(cid:48) , y (cid:48) ))+
=
pE (x, y (cid:48) )qG ( ˜x(cid:48) |x, y (cid:48) ) log(1 − D( ˜x(cid:48) , y (cid:48) ))dxdy (cid:48)d ˜x(cid:48) ,

(12)

where we assume x and y (cid:48) are sampled independently.
We get the optimal discriminator D∗ by applying Euler-

Lagrange equation,
D∗ =
Finally plugging D∗ in LCGAN yields,

pE ( ˜x(cid:48) |x, y (cid:48) )
pE ( ˜x(cid:48) |x, y (cid:48) ) + qG ( ˜x(cid:48) |x, y (cid:48) )

where JSD is the Jensen-Shannon divergence. Since JSD is
always non-negative and reaches its minimum if and only
pE (x, y (cid:48) ) > 0}, G recovers the true conditional distribution
pE ( ˜x(cid:48) |x, y (cid:48) ) when D and G are trained optimally.
In addition, the reconstruction loss Ly

and identity preserving loss Lidt are all non-negative. Mini-
mizing these losses will keep the equilibrium of LCGAN . If
the encoder pE (y |x) and the feature extractor h(·) are trained

Proof of Proposition 0.1

Proof. For ∀u, v ∈ V , we deﬁne π(u, v) = 1 if u < v and
0 otherwise, w(u, v) measures the extent to which u should
be prefered over v ,
For any pair u, v , let

Lu,v = π(u, v)w(u, v) + π(v , u)w(v , u)

where π(u, v) is the ground-truth and w(v , u) is prediction
from Elo ranking network.

L = Σu<v ,u,v∈V Lu,v

Number of Pairs

To experimentally verify the number of pairs needed to learn
a rating, we sampled from UTKFace (Zhang and Qi 2017)
subsets of sizes 100, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000 and 10000, and
train Elo rating networks with different number of pairs
for each subset. As illustrated in Figure 12, to achieve a
Spearman correlation above 0.9, approximately 2n pairs are
needed, where n is the size of the subset. n log n compar-
isons are needed for exact recovery of ranking between n
objects. Through our ranking network, we need O(n) com-
parisons to learn rating that is close enough to the true at-
tribute strength and also keeping the space between objects.
Annotation of absolute attribute strength is very noisy and
usually takes O(n) annotations because of majority voting
(e.g. 3n if 3 workers per instance), our method doesn’t re-
quire more effort in annotation and pairwise comparisons are
easier to annotate comparing to absolute attribute strength,
which will lead to a faster ﬁnishing time in crowd-sourcing
phase.

Noise Resistance

2 , M

Considering there is noise when annotating the absolute la-
bels. Taking age annotation as an example, we assume an-
Unif (cid:0)− M
notators will give x an age Ω(cid:48) (x) that deviates from the
(cid:1), where M is the tie margin in Figure 13. As
true age Ω(x) by a random noise: Ω(cid:48) (x) = Ω(x) + z , z ∼
shown, the correlation curve of ratings drops slowly until the
noise level is too high. Although only the curve on SCUT-
FBP shows superior results over the ground-truth label, the
general trend is that the rating curves decrease slower than
the absolute label curves. This demonstrates the Elo rating
network’s potential of noise resistance.
We choose UTKFace dataset to investigate how condi-
tional synthesis results might be affected by margins. In Ta-
ble 6, Spearman correlations and Inception Scores evaluated
on UTKFace under different margin values are reported.

Figure 12: Number of pairs m v.s. Spearman correlation rs . Dif-
ferent subsets of images (of number n = 100, . . . , 10000) are ran-
domly selected from the UTKFace dataset. For each subset, differ-
ent number of pairs (denoted by m) are randomly sampled. The
ﬁcient that exceeds 0.9 is marked by a red asterisk symbol ∗. To
smallest number of pairs with a Spearman’s rank correlation coef-
achieve high correlations between ratings and labels (in terms of
|rs | ≥ 0.9), approximately 2n pairs are required.

Attention Visualization

The proposed Elo rating network is visualized using Grad-
CAM (Selvaraju et al. 2017). In Figure 14-a, local regions
that are critical for decision making are highlighted: for
CACD and UTKFace, aging indicators such as forehead
wrinkles, crow’s feet eyes (babies usually have big eyes) are
highlighted; for SCUT-FBP, the gradient map highlights fa-
cial regions like eyes, nose, pimples etc. Similar to DFI, if
viewing the rating as deep features, one can optimize over
the input image to obtain a new image with desired attribute
intensity. We thus invert the encoders to see what a “typi-
cal” image with extreme attribute intensity would look like
by optimizing the average face as shown in Figure 14-b.

IS and FID Scores

Additional Inception Scores (IS) (Salimans et al. 2016),
Fr ´echet Inception Distances (FID) (Heusel et al. 2017) are
reported in Table 7. Classiﬁers for evaluating classiﬁcation
accuracies are also used to compute Inception Scores and as
auxiliary classiﬁers in training Disc-CGAN/IPCGAN. The
unsupervised baselines have high Inception Scores and low
Fr ´echet Inception Distances but very low classiﬁcation accu-

Unsupervised baselines fail to edit source images to a desired attribute strength and show classiﬁcation accuracies close to a random guess
(around 20%), however, they have misleadingly high IS and low FID scores (because changes are subtle compared to the source images).

Additional Results

Additional results of our PC-GAN and two fully-supervised
baselines Cont-CGAN and Disc-CGAN/IPCGAN (Wang et
al. 2018b) on CACD, UTKFace, and SCUT-FBP datasets
are given in Figure 15, 16, and 17 respectively. Results for
unsupervised baselines are not shown since the changes in
outputs are subtle. For CACD, attribute values (from Attr0
to Attr4) correspond to ages of 15, 25, 35, 45 and 55; for
UTK, attribute values correspond to ages of 10, 30, 50, 70
and 90; for SCUT-FBP, attribute values correspond to scores

of 1.375, 2.125, 2.875, 3.625 and 4.5, respectively.

PC-GAN, Cont-CGAN and Disc-CGAN perform simi-
larly on CACD. Disc-GAN performs much worse on UTK-
Face and SCUT-FBP, presumably due to the discretization
of attribute strength. For example, in SCUT-FBP, the num-
ber of images are unevenly distributed across discretized
attribute groups, that is, groups with least and largest at-
tribute strength (attractiveness) have only limited images. In
this case, we are more likely to see mode collapse in Disc-
CGAN. As a result, Disc-CGAN is outputting same images
for Attr0 and Attr4 in Figure 8. PC-GAN and Cont-
CGAN have a similar quality in synthesized images in all
three datasets, which shows PC-GAN can synthesize images
of same qualities using pairwise comparisons.

formance with fully-supervised baselines and are signiﬁ-
cantly better than unsupervised methods.
